This is a continuation of the Android Game Framework built in the Kilobolt Android Game tutorial available at http://www.kilobolt.com/game-development-tutorial.html. Many thanks go to James Cho for taking the time to write such an excellent tutorial series - if you're wanting to truly understand how to get started writing Android games or just games in general, I highly recommend going through the tutorial yourself.

For everybody else, this serves as a forked version of the framework. Much as the original tutorial writer, I would encourage you to use this framework in your own games if you find it useful, and to even extend it and send patches for new features and bugfixes. I'm offering the code under a very permissive open-source license, which also happens to be very short and worth the read.

While I followed the tutorial fairly closely while working on this framework, I did make a few changes in the original files, usually in variable names or formatting.
